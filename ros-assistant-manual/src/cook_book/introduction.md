# Cook Book

Welcome to the Nix Home cook book.

These are short tutorials for specific tasks in Nix Home. They are not stand alone tutorials and expect you to have the context from the main tutorials. Please start with the [getting started](../getting_started/introduction.md) tutorial if you have not yet done so.
