# Foreword

The objective of Nix Home is to empower users by granting ownership over their technology in our homes. As consumer robots have increased in complexity, so has the data they collect. As the data they collect has become more personal, we are forced to confront the implications of our trust in them. We do not know how this information is used or how it is shared, because the inner workings of common house hold robots are intentionally obfuscated, using both technology and legal precedence. A robot who's source code cannot be audited simply cannot be trusted. Nix Home is an open source ecosystem, developed in a public space for all to see, to critique, and to refine. 

This project is not part of the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/); it's a hobby project I created by myself, but was strongly inspired by projects such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and particularly [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/). 

The objective of this manual is to provide a comprehensive guide to building your own secure and trustworthy robots using Nix Home. Using this guide, you will learn how to manage robot projects, integrate your robot with Home Assistant, and write configuration files to idempotently manage your robot's software stack. While learning these things, you will also discover other valuable features such as booting your robot off a network installer and pushing delta updates over ssh.

Keep in mind that while Nix Home is primarily focused on robots, it is not limited to robots. Any appliance capable of running Linux can be integrated with Home Assistant.

With these tools, you will be able to build robots to serve in your home with a full understanding of what they do, and full confidence that they can be trusted.
